I am a researcher in Econometrics, Machine Learning, and Mechanism Design, now joining a PhD program in Economics at UC San Diego. 

<better research statement here> I concentrate on theory for applied research, including, but not limited to the problems businesses face. For now you can check out our paper Treatment Allocation under Uncertain Costs

PhD requires a lot of sacrifices, so I need to remind myself, what motivates me most in my job, to continue doing it. I am motivated potential impact of my work and professional environment motivates me most.

My research agenda was formed during at my jobs: <a href='https://go.yandex/'>Yandex.Go</a>, <a href='http://econ.msu.ru/'>Department of Economics at Moscow State University</a> and <a href='https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/research-fellows'>Research Fellowship program at Stanford</a>. I am grateful to my former (and current) collegues for their contribution to my skills, knowledge and vision on what constitutes an important research.
